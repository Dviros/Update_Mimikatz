# Update_Mimikatz
Update-Mimikatz is an effort in efficiency.  Currently it consists of two files that (should) do the exact same thing: Upate the Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 with new versions of the powerkatz dll files.

Update-Mimikatz.sh is a bash script that takes the compiled dll files converts them to base64 strings and then replaces the old dll base64 strings with the new ones.  

Update-Mimikatz.ps1 is deleted.  It doesn't work and I'm not even close to getting around to fixing/finishing it.
